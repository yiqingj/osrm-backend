# 5.9.0
  - Changes from 5.8
  - Algorithm:
      - Multi-Level Dijkstra:
        - Plugins supported: `table`

# 5.8.0
  - Changes from 5.7
    - API:
      - polyline6 support in request string
      - new parameter `approaches` for `route`, `table`, `trip` and `nearest` requests.  This parameter keep waypoints on the curb side.
        'approaches' accepts both 'curb' and 'unrestricted' values.
        Note : the curb side depend on the `ProfileProperties::left_hand_driving`, it's a global property set once by the profile. If you are working with a planet dataset, the api will be wrong in some countries, and right in others.
    - NodeJs Bindings
      - new parameter `approaches` for `route`, `table`, `trip` and `nearest` requests.
    - Tools
      - `osrm-partition` now ensures it is called before `osrm-contract` and removes inconsitent .hsgr files automatically.
    - Features
      - Added conditional restriction support with `parse-conditional-restrictions=true|false` to osrm-extract. This option saves conditional turn restrictions to the .restrictions file for parsing by contract later. Added `parse-conditionals-from-now=utc time stamp` and `--time-zone-file=/path/to/file`  to osrm-contract
      - Command-line tools (osrm-extract, osrm-contract, osrm-routed, etc) now return error codes and legible error messages for common problem scenarios, rather than ugly C++ crashes
      - Speed up pre-processing by only running the Lua `node_function` for nodes that have tags.  Cuts OSM file parsing time in half.
      - osrm-extract now performs generation of edge-expanded-edges using all available CPUs, which should make osrm-extract significantly faster on multi-CPU machines
    - Files
      - .osrm.nodes file was renamed to .nbg_nodes and .ebg_nodes was added
    - Guidance
      - #4075 Changed counting of exits on service roundabouts
    - Debug Tiles
      - added support for visualising turn penalties to the MLD plugin
      - added support for showing the rate (reciprocal of weight) on each edge when used
      - added support for turn weights in addition to turn durations in debug tiles
    - Bugfixes
      - Fixed a copy/paste issue assigning wrong directions in similar turns (left over right)
      - #4074: fixed a bug that would announce entering highway ramps as u-turns
      - #4122: osrm-routed/libosrm should throw exception when a dataset incompatible with the requested algorithm is loaded
      - Avoid collapsing u-turns into combined turn instructions

# 5.7.1
    - Bugfixes
      - #4030 Roundabout edge-case crashes post-processing

# 5.7.0
  - Changes from 5.6
    - Algorithm:
      - OSRM object has new option `algorithm` that allows the selection of a routing algorithm.
      - New experimental algorithm: Multi-Level Dijkstra with new toolchain:
        - Allows for fast metric updates in below a minute on continental sized networks (osrm-customize)
        - Plugins supported: `match` and `route`
        - Quickstart: `osrm-extract data.osm.pbf`, `osrm-partition data.osrm`, `osrm-customize data.osrm`, `osrm-routed --algorithm=MLD data.osrm`
    - NodeJs Bindings
      - Merged https://github.com/Project-OSRM/node-osrm into repository. Build via `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_NODE_BINDINGS=On -DENABLE_MASON=On`.
      - `OSRM` object has new option `algorihtm="CH","CoreCH","MLD"`
    - Internals
      - Shared memory notification via conditional variables on Linux or semaphore queue on OS X and Windows with a limit of 128 OSRM Engine instances
    - Files
      - .osrm.datasource_index file was removed. Data is now part of .osrm.geometries.
      - .osrm.edge_lookup was removed. The option `--generate-edge-lookup` does nothing now.
      - `osrm-contract` does not depend on the `.osrm.fileIndex` file anymore
      - `osrm-extract` creates new file `.osrm.cnbg` and `.cnbg_to_ebg`
      - `osrm-partition` creates new file `.osrm.partition` and `.osrm.cells`
      - `osrm-customize` creates new file `.osrm.mldgr`
    - Profiles
      - Added `force_split_edges` flag to global properties. True value guarantees that segment_function will be called for all segments, but also could double memory consumption
    - Map Matching:
      - new option `gaps=split|ignore` to enable/disbale track splitting
      - new option `tidy=true|false` to simplify traces automatically

# 5.6.3

      - Fix #3605 Fixed a bug that could lead to turns at the end of the road to be suppressed
      - Fix #2844 handle up to 16777215 code units in OSM names
    - Infrastructure
      - Support building rpm packages.
    - Guidance
      - No longer emitting turns on ferries, if a ferry should use multiple docking locations
    - Profiles
      - Removed the `./profile.lua -> ./profiles/car.lua` symlink. Use specific profiles from the `profiles` directory.
      - `properties` object has a new `weight_name` field, default value is "duration"
      - `properties` object has a new `weight_precision` field that specifies a decimal precision of edge weights, default value 1
      - In `way_function` the filed `forward_rate` and `backward_rate` of `ExtractionWay` can now be set.
        They have the same interpretation for the way weight as `forward_speed` and `backward_speed` for the edge duration.
        The unit of rate is meters per weight unit, so higher values will be prefered during routing.
      - `turn_function` now does not return an integer but takes in a `ExtractionTurn` object and can modify the `weight` and `duration` fields
      - `segment_function` now takes in a `ExtractionSegment` object and can modify `weight` and `duration` fields
      - `properties.uturn_penalty` is deprecated. Set it in the `turn_function`. The turn type is exposed as `ExtractionTurn::direction_modifier`.
      - `properties.traffic_light_penalty` is deprecated. Traffic light penalties now need to be set over in the turn function.
         Each turn with a traffic light is marked with `ExtractionTurn::has_traffic_light = true`.
      - Renamed the helper file `profiles/lib/directional.lua` to `profiles/lib/tags.lua` since it now provides more general tags parsing utility functions.
      - The car and foot profiles now depend on the helper file `profiles/lib/handlers.lua`.
    - Infrastructure
      - Disabled link-time optimized (LTO) builds by default. Enable by passing `-DENABLE_LTO=ON` to `cmake` if you need the performance and know what you are doing.
      - Datafile versioning is now based on OSRM semver values, rather than source code checksums.
        Datafiles are compatible between patch levels, but incompatible between minor version or higher bumps.
      - libOSRM now creates an own watcher thread then used in shared memory mode to listen for data updates
    - Tools:
      - Added osrm-extract-conditionals tool for checking conditional values in OSM data
    - Trip Plugin
      - Added a new feature that finds the optimal route given a list of waypoints, a source and a destination. This does not return a roundtrip and instead returns a one way optimal route from the fixed source to the destination points.

# 5.5.1
  - Changes from 5.5.0
    - API:
      - Adds `generate_hints=true` (`true` by default) which lets user disable `Hint` generating in the response. Use if you don't need `Hint`s!

      - debug.lua was added to make it easier to test/develop profile code.
      - `car.lua` now depends on lib/set.lua and lib/sequence.lua
      - `restrictions` is now used for namespaced restrictions and restriction exceptions (e.g. `restriction:motorcar=` as well as `except=motorcar`)
      - replaced lhs/rhs profiles by using test defined profiles
      - Handle `oneway=alternating` (routed over with penalty) separately from `oneway=reversible` (not routed over due to time dependence)
      - Handle `destination:forward`, `destination:backward`, `destination:ref:forward`, `destination:ref:backward` tags
      - Properly handle destinations on `oneway=-1` roads
    - Guidance

    - Debug Tiles
      - Added support for turn penalties
    - Internals
      - Internal/Shared memory datafacades now share common memory layout and data loading code
